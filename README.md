# 8-bit-CPU
A synthesizable 8-bit CPU written in SystemVerilog and targeted to Xilinx Vivado. This project demonstrates how to build a complete, customizable processor entirely in FPGA fabric, from the arithmetic-logic unit through to instruction fetch, decode and execute, with a comprehensive testbench for verification.
