# 8-bit-CPU
This project implements a simple 8-bit CPU in SystemVerilog, targeted at the Digilent Basys-3 FPGA. The CPU supports basic arithmetic and logic operations, a small register file, instruction ROM and RAM, and a UART interface so you can send commands and receive results directly from your laptop.
